# ellipsoid-fitting-with-CPS

Note that the ellipsoid produced by fitting the data in PointCloud_Standard.txt is the groundtruth for the synthetic dataset.

The paper that proposes Ellipsoid fitting with CPS is under review. For prevention of copyright disputes, the MATLAB code and correpsonding test dataset will be normally available after this paper is published. Even so, the Matlab code is still attached and it is only for better peer-review.

If you have any questions, please contact me.
